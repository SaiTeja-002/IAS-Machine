# IAS-Machine

![IAS machine architecture](IAS.png)

- The program "IAS_Machine.py" is an implementation of the IAS computer using Python 3.9.1 as the programming language. 
- The programming is done on the basis of “Fetch and Execute” method. 
- The program includes most of the instructions used in the IAS machine. 
- The C equivalent codes of the functions used are written in separate ‘.c’ files.

Brief overview of the functions used in the code
- binary_int() : It returns the decimal value of the binary list passed. 
- empty() : Returns True if all the integers of the list are non-zero(i.e., 1). 
- Increment() : It is used to increment the binary value of the passed binary list by 1. 
- list_string() : It is used to convert the given list into a string. 
- take_data() : It is used to get data from a particular location of the memory. 
- bin_adress() : It returns the 12-bit address of the 20-bit instruction.
